# Development Plan: Guess That Official

**Status**: PLAN-GuessThatOfficial  
**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-07

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Original Problem Statement
Alex works in corporate compliance and frequently interacts with Secretary of State offices across all 51 states. His team of 8 people has weekly meetings where they want to play fun, work-related games. Alex previously created a successful Jeopardy game using PowerPoint for a previous job, but now wants to leverage his technical skills to create a web-based game that's more engaging and easier to manage.

### Core Solution
"Guess That Official" - A web-based game where players identify public/government officials from their photos. The game will be used during team meetings via screen sharing, where Alex hosts the game and participants call out answers. The game includes multiple modes (identify official from photo, find correct photo from name, mixed mode with fake photos for humor) and tracks scoring for team engagement.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Functional game that can be played during 30-minute team meetings
- [ ] Easy admin interface for adding new officials and photos
- [ ] Multiple game modes with scoring system
- [ ] Simple setup that works via screen sharing in Teams meetings
- [ ] Extensible design for future game types (Jeopardy, etc.)

## 🏗️ Technical Strategy

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML + vanilla JavaScript (no complex frameworks needed)
- **Database**: JSON files for data storage (simple, no database setup required)
- **Storage**: Local file system for photos and game assets
- **Deployment**: Docker + docker-compose (for consistency with other projects)
- **APIs/Services**: None for MVP

### Architecture Approach
- **Phase 1**: Core game mechanics and basic UI (MVP working game)
- **Phase 2**: Admin interface and content management
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced scoring and game modes
- **Phase 4**: Production polish and deployment

### Key Integration Points
- **File System**: Local storage for photos and JSON data files
- **Docker Network**: Integration with existing supametabase network if needed
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained for reliability during meetings

### Resource Constraints
- Target: 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM droplet efficiency
- Follows 75% function, 25% design principle
- Must be resource-conscious alongside other services
- Simple enough to run reliably during important team meetings

## 📋 Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (1 day)
**Goal**: Basic game functionality working end-to-end

#### Environment Setup
- [ ] Create project structure with proper directories
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment
- [ ] Install core dependencies (Flask, Pillow for image handling)
- [ ] Configure logging architecture
- [ ] Create basic .env configuration

#### Core Game Implementation
- [ ] GameService class for core game logic
- [ ] Official data model (name, position, state, photo_path, fun_facts)
- [ ] Game session management (participants, scoring, current question)
- [ ] Basic game modes (identify official from photo)
- [ ] Simple scoring system (points per correct answer)
- [ ] JSON file I/O for official data storage

#### Basic Web Interface
- [ ] Flask app with game routes
- [ ] Game setup page (participants, game mode selection)
- [ ] Game play interface (photo display, answer input, scoring)
- [ ] Simple admin page for adding officials
- [ ] Basic CSS styling for clean presentation

**Phase 1 Success**: Can run a basic game session with sample officials

### Phase 2: Enhanced Game Modes (1 day)
**Goal**: Multiple game modes and improved gameplay

#### Advanced Game Features
- [ ] Multiple choice answer system
- [ ] "Find the Official" mode (name → pick photo)
- [ ] Mixed mode with random question types
- [ ] Fake photo integration for humor
- [ ] Timer functionality for questions
- [ ] Streak tracking and bonus points

#### Enhanced UI/UX
- [ ] Improved game interface with better photo display
- [ ] Answer reveal animations
- [ ] Score display and leaderboard
- [ ] Game session controls (pause, next, end)
- [ ] Responsive design for screen sharing

#### Content Management
- [ ] Photo upload functionality
- [ ] Official metadata editing
- [ ] Category management (SoS, Governors, etc.)
- [ ] Bulk import/export for official data

**Phase 2 Success**: Full-featured game with multiple modes and admin tools

### Phase 3: Production Polish (1 day)
**Goal**: Reliable, maintainable service ready for team meetings

#### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Error handling for missing photos/files
- [ ] Game state persistence (resume interrupted sessions)
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Logging for debugging game issues

#### Dockerization
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile with all dependencies
- [ ] docker-compose.yml with proper networking
- [ ] Volume mapping for photos and data persistence
- [ ] Resource limits configuration

#### Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Game setup instructions for team meetings
- [ ] Admin guide for adding new officials
- [ ] Basic integration tests for game logic
- [ ] Example official data structure

**Phase 3 Success**: Production-ready game service running in Docker

## ⚠️ Technical Risks & Mitigation

### Known Challenges
- **Photo Management**: Manual photo collection and organization → Start with 10-15 sample officials, build admin tools for easy addition
- **Game State Management**: Complex state during screen sharing → Keep it simple, manual controls for game flow
- **File Storage**: Photo file sizes and organization → Implement proper file structure and cleanup

### Resource Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Photo loading and caching → Implement lazy loading for photos
- **Storage Growth**: Photo accumulation → Regular cleanup of unused photos
- **Performance**: Large photo files → Optimize image sizes and caching
